<summary><h3>Task 1: </h3> 
<h2>Installation of RISC-V toolchain using VDI. Uploading the snapshot of compiled C code and RISC-V Objdmp on the GitHub repo</h2>
</summary>

The task 1 of the internship includes the following
- Installation of RISC-V toolchain using VDI.
- C Program for sum from one to n.
- Checking the result of C code
- RISC-V Simulator for compiling and running the code
- Assembly language

Overall, it is about writing the C code for sum from one to n followed by compiling and running by RISC-V Simulator.

 The steps to be followed are:
 
#### Step 1: Installation of Oracle VirtualBox.

The VirtualBox is an open source software and an operating system which runs as a physical computer inside the pc/laptop.

#### Step 2: Open the terminal inside the VirtualBox

 Note for the above command explanation:
 - command line cd is to check for home directory.
 - leafpad to open editor.
 - sum_one_to_one is the file name for C code to be written in editor.


#### Step 4: Write the C program for sum of one to n in the terminal 

The leafpad editor opened, write the simple c code for sum of 1 to n,

Save the file in the editor

 <h3>Task2:</h3>
</b> <h2>Performing SPIKE Simulation and Debugging a simple C code with Interactive Debugging Mode using Spike</h2></summary> 
  
### What is SPIKE in RISCV?
> * A RISC-V ISA is a simulator, enabling the testing and analysis of RISC-V programs without the need for actual hardware.  
> * Spike is a free, open-source C++ simulator for the RISC-V ISA that models a RISC-V core and cache system. It can be used to run programs and a Linux kernel, and can be a starting point for running software on a RISC-V target.  
  
### What is pk (Proxy Kernel)?  
> * The RISC-V Proxy Kernel, pk , is a lightweight application execution environment that can host statically-linked RISC-V ELF binaries.  
> * A Proxy Kernel in the RISC-V ecosystem simplifies the interaction between complex hardware and the software running on it, making it easier to manage, test, and develop software and hardware projects.  
 

### Testing the SPIKE Simulator  
The target is to run the ```findPrime.c``` code using both ```gcc compiler``` and ```riscv compiler```, and both of the compiler must display the same output on the terminal. So to compile the code using **gcc compiler**, use the following command:  
```
gcc findPrime.c  
./a.out
```
And to compile the code using **riscv compiler**, use the following command:  
```
spike pk findPrime.o
```

#### Following are the snapshots of RISCV Objdump with **-O1** and **-Ofast** options  
RISCV Objdump with -O1 option  

![Objdump in -O1](https://github.com/chanduputta/vsdsquadronmini-Research-internship/blob/main/Task2/Objdump%20in%20-O1.png)

RISCV Objdump with -Ofast option  

![Objdump in -Ofast](https://github.com/Prawinkumarjs/VSDSquadron-mini-internship/blob/main/Task%202/3.png)

### Debugging the Assembly Language Program of  ```findPrime.c```  
* Open the **Objdump** of code by using the following command  
```
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d findPrime.o | less  
```
* Open the debugger in another terminal by using the following command  
```
$ spike -d pk findPrime.o
```
* The debugger will be opened in the terminal. Now, debugging operations can be performed as shown in the following snapshot.
