<summary><h3>Task 1: </h3> Installation of RISC-V toolchain using VDI. Uploading the snapshot of compiled C code and RISC-V Objdmp on the GitHub repo</summary>

The task 1 of the internship includes the following
- Installation of RISC-V toolchain using VDI.
- C Program for sum from one to n.
- Checking the result of C code
- RISC-V Simulator for compiling and running the code
- Assembly language

Overall, it is about writing the C code for sum from one to n followed by compiling and running by RISC-V Simulator.

 The steps to be followed are:
 
#### Step 1: Installation of Oracle VirtualBox.

The VirtualBox is an open source software and an operating system which runs as a physical computer inside the pc/laptop.

#### Step 2: Open the terminal inside the VirtualBox

#### Step 3: To open the editor named leafpad for writing C code.

 Note for the above command explanation:
 - command line cd is to check for home directory.
 - leafpad to open editor.
 - sum_one_to_one is the file name for C code to be written in editor.


#### Step 4: Write the C program for sum of one to n in the terminal 

The leafpad editor opened, write the simple c code for sum of 1 to n,

Save the file in the editor
